# Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/frank-dspeed/example-typechecking-mjs
code example-typechecking-mjs
``` 

click on the index.mjs it will turn red. watch for the import statment.

in the working folder you find the same structure but it will not error and let you click on the imported module and it has type awareness

once https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/27957 is solved that will not be needed anymore but it will take some years.
